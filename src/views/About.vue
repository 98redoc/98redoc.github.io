    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
  My name is <strong>Anh Tra</strong>, a back-end Machine Learning engineer in Danang,
  Vietnam. I previously earned a Bachelor of Telecommunication and Electronics
  Engineering from Danang Unversity of Technologies (<span>DUT</span>), and got
  a research scholarship at Nanyang Technological University (<span>NTU</span>).
  During my journey at <span>NTU</span>, I was a PhD student in the group
  research of
  <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/wslin/">Prof. Weisi Lin</a> and
  <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eackot/">Prof. Alex Kot</a> at the
  Rapid-Rich Object Search (<a href="https://rose.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx"
    ><span>ROSE</span></a
  >) Lab, where I performed five years of studies in signal processing and
  computer science before unfortunately exiting the&nbsp;program.
</p>
<p>
  My interest lies in machine learning, especially in deep learning and computer
  vision. I have earned a certificate of Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.
  I can code Deep Learning with Keras, Pytorch, Caffe, etc., but TensorFlow is
  the one I have the most experience in. I have also contributed a workshop
  session named
  <a href="https://io.gdgmientrung.com/en/rolling-in-the-deep-with-tensorflow/"
    >“Rolling in the Deep with TensorFlow”</a
  >
  for the Google Developer Group Mientrung in&nbsp;2019.
</p>
<p>
  From late 2017 to mid 2019, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at
  Hitachi Consulting Vietnam, where I had chances to join in many interesting
  machine learning applied projects, from IoT, Predictive Maintenance,
  Recommender System, Computer Vision and Digital&nbsp;Transformation.
</p>
<p>
  Since July 2019, I am working as a R&amp;D Group Leader at
  <span>AI</span> Division, D-Soft <span>JSC</span>. This is a startup providing
  Software Solutions powered by <span>AI</span> and <span>DL</span> technologies
  for the East Asia and Southest Asia markets. For my full <span>CV</span>, you
  can see

<p>
  Last but not least, I am planing to write some chill tech blogs here in my
  site, so please check them and&nbsp;enjoy!
